##Introduction

The first lab is intended to let us install and make some basic configuration of the servers and clients. It also includes some firewall setting up.

If you somewhere get stuck and need directions for reading you can mail Mirza Durakovic <md222hz@student.lnu.se>, but try to be specific of what problem you are facing. You are also recommended to keep a welldocumented overview of the network and configuration files you have worked with.

##Deadline

You should present your solution at one of the lab seminars either on the **28/1 or 29/1 - 2016**. The requirements will be tested. That includes restarting the machines to see that the changes you have made are persistant.
