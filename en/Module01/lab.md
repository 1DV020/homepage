##Introduction
This lab is divided into two parts:
### 1. Server Installation
*This part is not mandatory by highly recommended.*

Since we moved our lab environment to a cloud-based solution you won't be able to install an server OS since it uses pre-defined images.
So to get a feel of who the installation process work you will do this in Virtual Box on you own personal computer. I have made a instruction video how to do this:

### 2. Setting up the lab environment
**This part is mandatory.**

The first lab is intended to let us setup the basic network and make some configuration of the servers and clients. It also includes some firewall setting up.

If you somewhere get stuck and need directions for reading you can mail Petko Gerdzhikov <pg222dt@student.lnu.se>, but try to be specific of what problem you are facing. You are also recommended to keep a well documented overview of the network and configuration files you have worked with.

##Deadline

You should present your solution at one of the lab either on the **24/1 or 27/1 - 2017**. The requirements will be tested. That includes restarting the machines to see that the changes you have made are persistent.
