##Introduction
We have made some changes to the lab environment and there are some other this you'll need to know before staring this lab. I have made an video that you should watch. The web interface to CScloud has changed a bit from when i recorded the video, the Security Groups are now located under the Network tab.

Now that you have set up the basic network and made sure the machines can communicate, it's time to move on and configure some file servers.
Lab memo will be found below

If you somewhere get stuck and need directions ask your question on Slack, but try to be specific of what problem you are facing. You are also recommended to keep a well documented overview of the network and configuration files you have worked with.
