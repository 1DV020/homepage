##Introduction
We have made some changes to the lab environment and there are some other this you'll need to know before staring this lab. I have made an video that you should watch:

Now that you have set up the basic network and made sure the machines can communicate, it's time to move on and configure some file servers.
Lab memo will be found below

[Lab 2.pdf](https://github.com/1DV020/labs/raw/master/Lab%202/Lab_2.pdf)

If you somewhere get stuck and need directions for reading you can mail Maxim Kravchenko <mk223hm@student.lnu.se>, but try to be specific of what problem you are facing. You are also recommended to keep a well documented overview of the network and configuration files you have worked with.

##Deadline

You should present your solution at the lab **9/2 - 2018**. The requirements will be tested. That includes restarting the machines to see that the changes you have made are persistent.
