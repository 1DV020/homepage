##Introduction


Lab memo will be found below

[Lab 2.pdf](https://github.com/1DV020/labs/raw/master/Lab%202/Lab_2.pdf)

If you somewhere get stuck and need directions for reading you can mail Mirza Durakovic <md222hz@student.lnu.se>, but try to be specific of what problem you are facing. You are also recommended to keep a welldocumented overview of the network and configuration files you have worked with.

##Deadline

You should present your solution at one of the lab either on the **12/2 - 2016**. The requirements will be tested. That includes restarting the machines to see that the changes you have made are persistant.
