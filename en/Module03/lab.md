##Introduction
In this lab we will cover 2 concepts: DNS and a Web server -
and see how they work together. As previously we will be using the lab from
where we left off.

Lab memo will be found below

If you somewhere get stuck and need directions for reading you can mail Petko Gerdzhikov <pg222dt@student.lnu.se>, but try to be specific of what problem you are facing. You are also recommended to keep a well documented overview of the network and configuration files you have worked with.

##Deadline

You should present your solution at one of the lab session no later then 24/2 - 2017. The requirements will be tested. That includes restarting the machines to see that the changes you have made are persistent.
