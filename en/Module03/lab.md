##Introduction
In this Laboration we will cover 3 concepts: DHCP, DNS and a Web server -
and see how they work together. As previously we will be using the lab from
where we left off. We will also introduce a new VMNet (5) and add another server there - dmzserver.

Our previous Linux server will act as a DNS for mycompany.lab. The new dmzserver will act as our web server for mycompany.lab and the windows server will be responsible for handing out IP addresses with DHCP.

Lab memo will be found below

If you somewhere get stuck and need directions for reading you can mail Mirza Durakovic <md222hz@student.lnu.se>, but try to be specific of what problem you are facing. You are also recommended to keep a welldocumented overview of the network and configuration files you have worked with.

##Deadline

You should present your solution at one of the lab seminars no later then 26/2 - 2016. The requirements will be tested. That includes restarting the machines to see that the changes you have made are persistent.
