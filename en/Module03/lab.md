##Introduction
In this Laboration we will cover 3 concepts: DHCP, DNS and a Web server -  and see how they work together. As previously we will be using the lab from where we left off. We will also introduce a new VMNet (VMNet5) that will be having our DMZ on.

The Linux server will be the main DNS for mycompany.lab. The Linux server will also act as webserver for mycompany.lab and the windows server will be responsible for handing out IPa ddresses with DHCP.

Lab memo will be found below

##Deadline

You should present your solution at one of the lab seminars either on the xx/x or 27/3 - 2015. The requirements will be tested. That includes restarting the machines to see that the changes you have made are persistant.
